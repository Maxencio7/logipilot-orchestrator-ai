# This file can be empty or used to conveniently import CRUD functions
# For example:
# from .crud_user import user
# from .crud_item import item

# For now, we'll leave it empty and import specific modules as needed.
# This helps in organizing CRUD operations for different models.
# Each model (e.g., User, Client, Shipment) will have its own crud_*.py file.
